Send email marketing campaigns with [Amazon SES](https://aws.amazon.com/ses/). Let [Amazon Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) compose email by email and literaly scale it to infinite.  Use this [React powered frontend](https://microapps.github.io/MoonMail-UI/) to shoot your email marketing campaigns with your AWS/SES credentials. We're assuming that:

  -  You have set up the [Serverless](https://serverless.com/) project as described in the [documentation](https://github.com/microapps/MoonMail#getting-started)
  - You are using a SES endpoint that has production access (not sandbox mode)
  - You have created a recipients list and added some recipients to it through the API
